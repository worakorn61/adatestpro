# Introduction

`DrillDown` is a powerful report type in data analysis. It allows your data to summarize in highest level then break down to smaller one. All level break-down data can be visualized in charts or tables for your better understanding of data.

This package contains 3 different widgets: `DrillDown`, `CustomDrillDown` and `MultiView`.

# Installation

1. Unzip `drilldown.zip`
2. Copy `drilldown` folder into `koolreport\packages`
3. All done! Now you can use the package in your report.

# DrillDown Widget

`DrillDown` is an widget that allows you to setup an drill-down report in fastest and easiest way. All you need to do are:

1. Setup SQL Statement to withdraw data
2. Setup multi-levels of drill-down.
3. On each level of drill-down, choose chart type to visualize data


### Example

```
<?php 
DrillDown::create(array(
    "name"=>"saleReportByLocation",
    "title"=>"Sale By Location",
    //Define dataSource which is SQL statement to load all table
    "dataSource"=>(
        $this->src("mydata")->query("SELECT country, state, city, sale_amount FROM orders")
    ),
    //What we want to calculate
    "calculate"=>array(
        "sum"=>"sale_amount"
    ),
    "levels"=>array(
        //Level 1: Group all table by country, showing all countries with `sale_amount` by country.
        array(
            "groupBy"=>"country",
            "widget"=>array(ColumnChart::class,array(
                "columns"=>array("country","sale_amount")
            ))
            "title"=>"All countries",
        ),
        //Level 2: When user select a country, the widget shows `sale_amount` by state of that country
        array(
            "groupBy"=>"state",
            "widget"=>array(ColumnChart::class,array(
                "columns"=>array("state","sale_amount")
            )),
            "title"=>function($params)
            {
                return $params["country"];
            }
        ),
        //Level 3: When user continues to select a state, then widget will show  `sale_amount` by city of that state
        array(
            "groupBy"=>"city",
            "widget"=>array(Table::class,array(
                "columns"=>array("city","sale_amount")
            )),
            "title"=>function($params)
            {
                return $params["city"];
            }
        )
    )
));
?>
```

            return false;//Cancel action
        }",
        "nexted"=>"function(params){
            console.log('Nexted to'+params.level);
        }",
    );
));
?>
```


# CustomDrillDown

`CustomDrillDown` extends the capability to the max. It does not limit the number of charts in a level, you can show any custom content inside a level of drilldown. Due to flexibility, `CustomDrillDown` is a little more complicated to handle than normal drilldown above. To summarize the comparison between `CustomDrillDown` and `DrillDown`

1. CustomDrillDown is faster than DrillDown since CustomDrillDown use the SubReport technology.
2. When callback, only subreport of CustomDrillDown runs so it is more efficient while DrillDown will run the whole main report so it is less efficient.
3. In CustomDrillDown, you need to setup subreport and connecting them with parameters while in DrillDown, you do not need to, we handle all for you.
4. In sum, DrillDown vs CustomDrillDown is the trade-off between the convenience and the powerfulness, the easiness and the complexity.

Below is a tutorial to setup a basic CustomDrillDown:

#### __Step 1:__ Create CountrySale report

The CountrySale report is created in the same way you create a single report. In this CountrySale report, we summarize sale by country and display all countries. When user select a country, it called DrillDown next() function to pass the selection parameters to the next level.

```
<?php
class CountrySale extends \koolreport\KoolReport
{
    protected function settings()
    {
        return array(
            "dataSources"=>array(
                "mydatabase"=>array(
                    "connectionString"=>"mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydata",
                    "username"=>"root",
                    "password"=>"",
                    "charset"=>"utf8"
                )
            )
        );
    }

    protected function setup()
    {
        $this->src("mydatabase")
        ->query("SELECT country, sum(amount) AS sale_amount FROM orders GROUP BY country")
        ->pipe($this-dataStore("sale_by_country"));
    }
}
```

```
<?php 
    //CountrySale.view.php
    use \koolreport\widgets\google\ColumnChart;
    $drilldown = $this->params["@drilldown"]
?>

<level-title>All Countries</level-title>

<?php
ColumnChart::create(array(
    "dataSource"=>$this->dataStore("sale_by_country"),
    "clientEvents"=>array(
        "itemSelect"=>"function(params){
            $drilldown.next({state:params.selectedRow[0]});
        }"
    )
))
?>
```

#### __Step 2:__ Create StateSale report

The StateSale report is created in the same way that you create a single report. StateSale report will receive a parameter called "country" which is the selected country from user. It will summarize the sale_amount by state in that country.

```
<?php
class StateSale extends \koolreport\KoolReport
{
    protected function settings()
    {
        return array(
            "dataSources"=>array(
                "mydatabase"=>array(
                    "connectionString"=>"mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydata",
                    "username"=>"root",
                    "password"=>"",
                    "charset"=>"utf8"
                )
            )
        );
    }

    protected function setup()
    {
        $this->src("mydatabase")
        ->query("
            SELECT 
                state, sum(amount) AS sale_amount 
            FROM orders
            WHERE
                country=:country
            GROUP BY state
        ")
        ->params(array(
            ":country"=>$this->params["country"]
        ))
        ->pipe($this-dataStore("sale_by_state"));
    }
}
```

```
<?php 
    //CountrySale.view.php
    use \koolreport\widgets\google\ColumnChart;
    $drilldown = $this->params["@drilldown"]
?>

<level-title>States of <?php echo $this->params["country"]; ?></level-title>

<?php
ColumnChart::create(array(
    "dataSource"=>$this->dataStore("sale_by_state"),
))
?>
```

#### __Step 3:__ Create MainReport

The MainReport defines the CountrySale and StateSale as subreports and create CustomDrillDown at the view.

```
<?php
class MainReport extends \koolreport\KoolReport
{
    use \koolreport\clients\Bootstrap;
    protected function settings()
    {
        return array(
            "subReports"=>array(
                "countrysale"=>CountrySale::class,
                "statesale"=>StateSale::class
            )
        );
    }

    protected function setup()
    {
    }
}
```

```
<?php 
    //MainReport.view.php
    use \koolreport\drilldown\CustomDrillDown;
?>

<html>
    <head>
        <title> Sale By Location</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <?php
        CustomDrillDown::create(array(
            "name"=>"locationSale"
            "title"=>"Sale By Location",
            "subReports"=>array("countrysale","statesale"),
        ))
        ?>
        ```
    </body>
</html>
```

As result of above settings, now you have a drilldown report that will show all countries with the sales achived in each country. When user selects a particular country, the drilldown will show the sale_amount by each states in that country. Awesome, is it?

Each levels of drill-down report is handled by a sub report which virtually you can customize the interface in the way you want. All you need to do is to call next() function of drill down, sending all selected values then wait for drilldown to move to next level.

        "nexting"=>"function(params){
            return false;//Cancel action
        }",
        "nexted"=>"function(params){
            console.log('Nexted to'+params.level);
        }",
    );
));
?>
```



# MultiView

`MultiView` has another name called drill-through report. It let you see the same data but in different angles, different charts so that you can understand data better. In `MultiView` we setup several views, each view holds a different chart. All the views shares the same datasource.

### Example

```
<?php
    MultiView::create(array(
        "name"=>"multiviewer",
        "dataSource"=>$this->dataStore("data"),
        "views"=>array(
            array(
                "handler"=>"<i class='fa fa-bar-chart'></i>",
                "widget"=>array(BarChart::class,array(
                    "name"=>"mychart",
                    "columns"=>array("year","amount")
                ))
            ),
            array(
                "handler"=>"<i class='fa fa-table'></i>",
                "widget"=>array(Table::class,array(
                    "columns"=>array("year","amount")
                ))
            ), 
        ),
    ));
    ?>           
```

As we can see in the example, we setup a `MultiView` called __multiviewer__ with a datasource. We setup two views, one holds a BarChart and another one holds a Table. User can switch between the between views by using the handler.

### Properties

|name|type|default|description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`name`|string||`*Required` Name of the MultiView|
|`title`|string||The title of MultiView that will appears on the top|
|`template`|string|"panel"|Set the template of the MultiView, default value is "panel".|
|`options`|array||Holding the options available to specific template, please see more details at __options properties__.|
|`views`|array||An array of views and its settings, each views will have `handler` and `widget` property. The `handler` will hold the text of handler and the `widget` define which widget to show in the view together with its settings. Please see above example.|
|`clientEvents`|array||Register client events, please view Client Events for more details|


### Client events

`DrillDown` support following events:

|name|description|
|---|---|
|`changing`|Fired when multiview is going to change view. Return `false` to cancel action.|
|`changed`|Fired when multiview changed index|

__Example__

```
<?php
MultiView::create(array(
    ...
    "clientEvents"=>array(
        "changing"=>"function(params){
            return false;//Cancel action
        }",
        "changed"=>"function(params){
            console.log('Change to'+params.index);
        }",
    );
));
?>
```
